# battlebros-north-expansion

This mod introduces a new origin, where you can play as a barbarian. All features of this mod are tied to this origin and all other origins are unchanged. The mod is still work in progress and so far considered a BETA. Bugs are present, as well as typos. Feel free to report all of them :)

## Barbarians of the North

You are a warrior and a raider. Your whole life has been battle and struggle and it's not about to change now.

**Barbarian Leader:** Start with a leader that has permanently bad relations with civilized factions but friendly with barbarian settlements. If the leader dies, the campaign ends.

**Barbarian dozen::** Can not have more than 12 men.

**Father's Sword:** Start with a greatsword inherited from your father.

**Mercenary Path:** Make decisions to become mercenary and remove restrictions or stay barbarian.

## Mod compatibility

Mod is pretty much intended to work with [Create your character mod] (https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/580) (that is also done by me)

## Installation

Download [this](https://github.com/tbabic/battlebros-north-expansion/releases/latest/download/north-expansion-mod.zip) file and copy if in your data folder
