# battlebros-north

You\'ve spent most of your years fighting, but after one battle too many and most of your clan and dead, you\'ve decided to lead your few remaining friends south.\

**Barbarian Leader:** Start with a leader that has bad relations with most human factions but can hire other barbarians. If the leader dies, the campaign ends.

**Pillagers:** You have a higher chance to get any items from slain enemies as loot.

**Furious dozen:** Can never have more than 12 men in your roster.
