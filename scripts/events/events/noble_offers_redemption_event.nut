Why should I listen to the likes of you.%SPEECH_OFF%Your first instinct is to take your sword and run it through the nobleman\'s mouth. However, you decide against it. Your second thought is to just turn around and leave, but you decide against that too. Instead, you decide to throw a bag of coins in front of him.

Not likely.%SPEECH_OFF%You look at your %noblebro% and give him your best expression of irritation and displeasure. He is calm though and slowly nods to you.
